## Main Objective

> The main objective of this project is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint (functional, non-functional and functional needs repair) for each record in the dataset based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed and how it is managed.

## Metric of Success

> To successfully predict the operating condition of a waterpoint (functional, non-functional and functional needs repair) for each record in the dataset.

## Context

> Using data from Taarifa[http://taarifa.org/] and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water[http://maji.go.tz/], can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities.

## Experimental Design 

* Importing the relevant libraries that we will use in our analysis
* Reading and exploring the dataset we will use for our project
* Defining the appropriateness of the available data with regards to the project
* Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
* Performing univariate and bivariate analysis while recording our observations.
* Implementing the solution by using the various classifier algorithms to predict whether a waterpoint is functional,non functional or functional but needs repair based on the information provided.
* Challenging the solution by using a model that could outperform the best performing model identified earlier.
* Providing conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis and various modelling techniques used in the project.
